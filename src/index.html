    <!-- Setup React. 
      We are using React via a CDN (content delivery network). 
      This means we aren't isntalling react or saving it to our project.
      Instead, we are loading it from a server hosting these files (the CDN). 
      This isn't how this is done for production apps, but is a good way to get started with little setup

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.15.0/babel.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Import Components
      The order matters here. The "head" of a webpage is loaded in order - so we had to load React before loading components that use React.
      We also need to pay attention to load order here - if App.js uses SelectionSet.js, 
      we need to load SelectionSet first so App.js will know about it
      -->
    <script src="./components/SelectionSet.js" type="text/jsx"></script>
    <script src="./App.js" type="text/jsx"></script>
  </head>

  <!-- The body is the main part of the webpage. It contains and displays the content. -->
  <body class="bg-dark">
    <div id="root"></div>
    <!-- This script inserts your react code into the div with the id "root" (line above). 
      It is javascript, but using HTML-like syntax called JSX (e.g. <App />). 
      This JSX is translating to regular HTML by the "babel" library so it can be displayed in the browser-->
    <script type="text/babel">
      ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
    </script>
    <!--
      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      With this setup using the CDN, when the user visits your site the babel library compiles (translates) your
      JSX into code the browser can understand (plain old javascript and HTML) before the page is displayed.
      This can be slow. Using the CDN is a fast way to get started coding with react within install anything, 
      but a more robust way is to use create-react-app. One difference is that using create-react-app we can
      run a script to "build the code". This makes a folder of compiled (translated) files. We host those
      files as our website, so when the user goes to the site the code is already translated - so less wait time.
