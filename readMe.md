Git & Github
Git is a system to tracking changes to files in a project. It makes it easy to undo mistakes, and makes it easier for multiple to code in the same project by managing merges between branches (sets of active changes). Github is a website that hosts code and has a great interface for viewing, tracking and reviewing these changes.
